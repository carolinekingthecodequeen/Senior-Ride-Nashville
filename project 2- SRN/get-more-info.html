					<h2>About Senior Ride Nashville</h1>
					<p>Senior Ride Nashville wants to foster a community that connects and empowers older adults. We believe the best way to do this is to connect seniors who no longer drive with volunteers who do. By giving older adults the ability to get around town and foster relationships with community members, we honor the city we live in and make it better for all.
						<br>
						<br>
						Senior Ride Nashville was created in 2016 by the Council on Aging of Middle Tennessee and the Senior Transportation Leadership Coalition with strong support from the local community. We offer special thanks to the West End Home Foundation, the HCA Foundation and the United Way of Metropolitan Nashville for their critical support and involvement in the planning and launch of Senior Ride Nashville.
						<br>
						<br>
						The support of our growing network of sponsors and community partners is crucial, including those organizations serving the senior population in Nashville and the many churches, synagogues, and mosques who help us identify older adults in need of transportation.</p>

					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h1>
					<p>
						<b> <i>Who is eligible to use Senior Ride Nashville?</i> </b>
						<br>
						To qualify for a membership, riders must be at least 60 years old, live in Davidson County and reside in one of our current service areas, no longer drive or limit their driving, and be able to transfer in and out of a vehicle with limited assistance. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<b> <i>How often can I schedule a ride?</i> </b>
						<br>
						We are currently able to accommodate up to two round trips per week/per rider. All rides are subject to volunteer driver availability.  Each round-trip can have a maximum of 2 stops and should be completed in 3 hours or less.  Services are currently available Monday-Friday between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b> <i>Are rides available on-demand?</i></b>
						<br>
						No.  Because rides are provided by volunteer drivers, ride requests should be made at least 7 days in advance.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b> <i>Is there a limit for destinations or total round-trip time?</i></b>
						<br>
						Yes.  Each round-trip should have a maximum of 2 stops and be completed in 3 hours or less.  If you plan to be out and about for more than three hours, just let us know at the time the reservation is made and we can assign two different drivers for each leg of the trip.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b> <i>What is required of volunteer drivers?</i></b>
						<br>
						Volunteer driver's will be 21 years of age or older, complete SRN orientation and training, provide proof of valid drivers license and vehicle insurance, have use of a vehicle, and successfully complete driving and criminal background checks.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b> <i>What is the time commitment?</i></b>
						<br>
						We ask volunteers to commit to at least two rides per month (exceptions are made for volunteer drivers who are away from Nashville for an extended period of time).  Round-trip rides should be completed in three hours or less with a maximum of two destinations.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b> <i>How are volunteer shifts scheduled?</i> </b>
						<br>
						Volunteers can either self-assign themselves to rides using our user-friendly, web-based software program, or can call the office for scheduling assistance.  
						<br>
